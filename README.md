## Project Overview

The N-Puzzle problem is a classic problem in artificial intelligence and is commonly used to demonstrate various search algorithms such as A*, Breadth-First Search (BFS), and Depth-First Search (DFS). Our project focuses on implementing and comparing these algorithms to find the most efficient solution for different N-Puzzle configurations.

## Features

- Implementations of A*, BFS, and DFS search algorithms.
- Customizable grid size (N) for different puzzle configurations.
- Heuristic functions for informed search algorithms.
- Visualizations of puzzle states and solution paths.

## Installation

To install and run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/n-puzzle-solver.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd n-puzzle-solver`
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run the main script: `python main.py`

## Usage

Once the project is running, follow the on-screen instructions to input the initial state of the puzzle and choose the desired search algorithm. The program will then display the solution path and the final solved state of the puzzle.
